        Phase I
        01. Chop the vegetables : Chop onion, tomatoes, green chilli, and garlic into small pieces (as per you like).
        02. Add little bit of water in the kettle, so that it makes a thin layer of water.
        03. Now add butter (or oil) and turn on the kettle. Add onion, garlic and green chilli.
        04. Once the onions start changing colours, add the chopped tomatoes at last.
        05. As the tomatoes release water, add Maggi Masala-e-magic.
        06. Mix well. Take everything out frm kettle.

        Phase II
        07. Clean kettle.
        08. Add water and boil it till it becomes lukewarm.
        09. Soak soya chunks in it for 10-15 minutes. After that, they will become soft and will be ready for use.
        10. Squeeze them to get rid of water and store them somewhere.
        11. Add the prepared vegetables and all into the kettle once again.
            Add some water. Add softened soya chunks.
