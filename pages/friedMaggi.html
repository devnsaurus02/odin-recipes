    <pre>
        1. Chop the vegetables : Chop onion, tomatoes, green chilli, and garlic into small pieces (as per you like).
        2. Add little bit of water in the kettle, so that it makes a thin layer of water.
        3. Now add butter (or oil) and turn on the kettle. Add onion, garlic and green chilli.
        4. Once the onions start changing colours, add the chopped tomatoes at last.
        5. As the tomatoes release water, add Maggi Masala-e-magic.
        6. Now stir everything, add some salt and red chilli powder. Add some water. Stir again.
        7. Add enough water to cook the noodles, then add them. Let them boil briefly, stirring well, until they reach your preferred texture.
