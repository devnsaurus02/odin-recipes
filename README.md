# odin-recipes

This repository contains files for my first project of [TheOdinProject's Foundations course](http://theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).

The project is to create a simple webpage to display some recipes. This showcases that the user has learnt basic html, and also how to commit and push to github using terminal.
